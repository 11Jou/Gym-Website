<p> Yoga is our most commonly requested group fitness class, and most people are already familiar with the concept of it. This type of exercise has nearly a dozen variations of its own, with the most popular styles including Hot Yoga, to Vinyasa Flow, and Gentle Yoga. The exercise itself consists of deliberate, concentrated movements and postures designed to promote flexibility, tone and strengthen muscles, and align the body. Most often, breathing techniques are also encompassed along with the movements, allowing participants a relaxing experience coinciding with the movement. The end of the class typically ends in a ‘Savasana’ or meditative pose on the back to conclude the practice. This class is ideal for someone looking for a relaxing, quiet routine that helps them release the day, while building muscle tone and flexibility.

<p>Pilates  is commonly compared for it’s similarities to Yoga. While Yoga focuses on strength and flexibility through long held, swift-moving postures and “grounding” positions to help you feel centered and balanced, Pilates brings a heavier element of core focus, with repetitive and small movements of isolated or full body muscle groups. In addition, PIlates tones the full body and promotes endurance. This routine uses movements like planks, side planks, and core exercises to enhance your muscles and core strength, all while promoting relaxation with integrated breathing.

<p> Circuit Training  classes are typically an interval-style, fast paced, shorter routine that does exactly as its name implies – a series of exercises that complete a circuit. Normally in this class setting, you complete one exercise (usually in a station) for anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute, and then move on to the next station/exercise for another 30 seconds to a minute, typically with a brief break in the routine once you complete one full circuit. Circuits can average 5-6 different exercises or stations, and you normally repeat the circuit 3-5 times, depending on the time one full circuit takes. This class is ideal for you are looking for a calorie-burning, strength-training fast paced workout.

<p> Water Aerobics  can be a fun way to engage muscle endurance and strength in a low-impact setting. This aerobic-style class usually involves light dumbbells and movements designed to get your heart pumping at a steady, consistent pace. Because of the lower intensity, classes are most effective in about an hour length time span. Normally, when you attend this type of class, you can expect a warm-up, a period of cardio, and some strength-training with smaller weights and a cool-down period. This workout is ideal for anyone who is looking for a steady, longer, low-impact routine that is exciting and unconventional from standard routines.

<p> 
    A Cycling class is great cardio workout that relies on a fitness center cycling machine, usually in a room designated for this type of fitness class. Often times, the class includes fast-paced upbeat tracks to help build the heart rate at different intervals over the course of the workout with alternating periods of sitting and standing, as well as adjusting the intensity or grade of the bike. Classes average around 45 minutes in length, and it’s a great idea to bring a towel and water bottle with you to this class – you’re going to need both!

When using the cycle machines for the first time, it’s really crucial to make sure you properly adjust the height of your seat and your bike handles to your own personal setting, and consult your instructor to make sure you have done this correctly and locked each piece into place for proper machine safety and reduction in the risk of improper knee form mechanics.
